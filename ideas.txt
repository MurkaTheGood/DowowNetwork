The codebase is doomed, so it must be reworked completely. The implementation must be defined exactly. So there it is.
Connection:
    1. has a thread called "polling thread", that handles all I/O operations.
    2. poll() is used in the polling thread to monitor events
    3. all descriptors are closed in the thread the were open from (as the select() manpage tells us to to)
    4. there are eventfds and timerfds used aside from connection socket:
        -   eventfd for nonpolling thread disconnection. Becomes readable when nonpolling thread asks for disconnection. When it becomes readable,
            the polling thread stops.
        -   eventfd for polling thread finishing. Becomes readable when the polling thread is finished.
        -   eventfd for Push() notification. Becomes readable when the send queue is not empty.
        -   timerfd for our still-alive timer. Expires when we haven't sent data within specified amount of time.
        -   timerfd for their not-alive timer. Expires when they haven't sent anything within specified amount of time.
